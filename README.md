# Crypto Trading Simulator v2 (Frontend)

Crypto Trading Simulator v2 is a React web app that simulates a cryptocurrency trading platform. This web app will have the same features as it did v1 with new features such as a chart component that plots the 30 day price change of a cryptocurrency, updated model associations that will help us keep track of the positions of a user and their trade history, and a transactions table. Redux will be used to handle our state management. We will be utilizing Axios to send async calls to our server. Our backend will be setup as a Rails API and we will be making use of Active Model Serializers to serialize the data weâ€™re sending back to the frontend.
